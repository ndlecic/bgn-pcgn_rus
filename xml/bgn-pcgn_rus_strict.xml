    BGN/PCGN Romanization System for Russian (Strict Variant)
    for Lingua::Translit Perl Module
    https://github.com/ndlecic/bgn-pcgn_rus

    Copyright 2017 Nikola D. Lečić <nikola.lecic@anthesphoria.net>
  ===========================================================================

  This implementation of BGN/PCGN romanization system comes in two
  variants:
    - strict
    - standard
  Please see respective XML files for explanations.

  The BGN/PCGN system was approved by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names
  (BGN) in 1944 and the Permanent Committee on Geographical Names for
  British Official Use (PCGN) in 1947.

  Terminology:
    character = a graphic symbol used only in a non-Roman script writing
                system
    letter    = a symbol used only in a Roman-script writing system
                or in a set of romanization equivalents
    (cf. p. iv).

  ===========================================================================
    About Strict Variant:
      In this variant of BGN/PCGN transliteration we follow all
      transliteration schemes for "unusual Russian character sequences"
      as described on p. 94.

             Abbreviations vs. All Caps

             Abbreviations are widely used in the Russian language, so
             it's important to have them transliterated properly (e.g.
             ВЦИОМ -> VTsIOM, not VTSIOM).

             On the other hand, it's impossible to determine if a
             character sequence is an abbreviation or a word written in
             all caps.

             Besides that, it is impossible to determine whether a common
             one-character word 'Я' appears in all caps environment (where
             it should be transliterated as 'YA') or not (in which case it
             should be transliterated as 'Ya').

             Another important case where it's impossible to determine if
             an uppercase character is in all caps environment are usual
             abbreviations of given names and patronymics; we want to
             transliterate Ю. Я. Щербаков as 'Ya. Yu. Shcherbakov', not as
             'YA. YU. Shcherbakov'.

             Therefore, we deliberately don't try to detect all caps
             environment in the rules. There are a lot of ways for a user
             to achieve a proper capitalization of transliterated output
             if it is needed.
